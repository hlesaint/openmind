Probing murine nociception via the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect is still challenging due to methodological constraints. Here we report on the reproducible application of acute noxious heat stimuli to examine the feasibility and limitations of functional brain mapping for central pain processing in mice. Recent technical and procedural advances were applied for enhanced BOLD signal detection and a tight control of physiological parameters. The latter includes the development of a novel mouse cradle designed to maintain whole-body normothermia in anesthetized mice during fMRI in a way that reflects the thermal status of awake, resting mice. Applying mild noxious heat stimuli to wildtype mice resulted in highly significant BOLD patterns in anatomical brain structures forming the pain matrix, which comprise temporal signal intensity changes of up to 6% magnitude.

Yet, most networks, especially the classical bilateral connectivity between hemispheres, have not been reliably found in the mouse brain. This could be due to anesthetic effects on neural activity and difficulty in maintaining proper physiology and neurovascular coupling in anesthetized mouse. For example, α2 adrenoceptor agonist, medetomidine, is a sedative for longitudinal mouse fMRI. However, the higher dosage needed compared to rats may suppress the functional synchrony and lead to unilateral connectivity. In this study, we investigated the influence of medetomidine dosage on neural activation and resting-state networks in mouse brain. We show that mouse can be stabilized with dosage as low as 0.1mg/kg/h. The stimulation-induced somatosensory activation was unchanged when medetomidine was increased from 0.1 to 6 and 10 folds. Especially, robust bilateral connectivity can be observed in the primary, secondary somatosensory and visual cortices, as well as the hippocampus, caudate putamen, and thalamus at low dose of medetomidine. Significant suppression of inter-hemispheric correlation was seen in the thalamus, where the receptor density is high, under 0.6mg/kg/h, and in all regions except the caudate, where the receptor density is low, under 1.0mg/kg/h. Furthermore, in mice whose activation was weaker or took longer time to detect, the bilateral connectivity was lower. This demonstrates that, with proper sedation and conservation of neurovascular coupling, similar bilateral networks like other species can be detected in the mouse brain.", :journal "NeuroImage.", :url "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24157920", :publication/date "2014-02-01T00:00:00.000-05:00"}, :author {:orcid-id "0000-0003-1053-9256", :name "Henning Matthias Reimann"}, :figures [#openmind.hash/ref "31f3753970c668a9c5fa89367f4033d5"], :text "Medetomidine has no dose-dependent effect on the BOLD response to subcutaneous electrostimulation (0.5, 0.75, 1 mA) in mice for doses of 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0 mg/kg/h."} {:tags [#openmind.hash/ref "fa251a5a680eed91f02c1b674a62a35b" #openmind.hash/ref "80b70c378bcbd02230124493708bda9f" #openmind.hash/ref "9ebf0075cc98d92342c6a3a74fe62ea2" #openmind.hash/ref "e8a93bf38d3a1b5b57a20327eb1aac18" #openmind.hash/ref "55e639ad3dd45960a6a1a48a632f3b39" #openmind.hash/ref "93a806e296ce2b8dae5f279874bd83e4" #openmind.hash/ref "8bd5f33733fec1678a4b372b402bf486" #openmind.hash/ref "bb1b33463b3f1c8423f24bbeea9f91dc" #openmind.hash/ref "97098616eab96a5376759bd3a951d13b" #openmind.hash/ref "35f5b330bd1e514ff0017aa2d2055ea1" #openmind.hash/ref "9f86df45b91061674e4e73785f9b590f" #openmind.hash/ref "593e805878e89707a53d109e9d17f639" #openmind.hash/ref "19214f31d6c0f412d15d8326ef73a686" #openmind.hash/ref "d0cba8b48722ce785c5bb81e3ca5b183" #openmind.hash/ref "57b4fcd442495d3eed420f6e0a9e469c" #openmind.hash/ref "ca55a158e278b3517d43bff606b6232b" #openmind.hash/ref "90f270725ca50bb799bf2d77afe9ce2e"], :hash #openmind.hash/ref "85030087c5b052dfd47e7843fe7c045a", :comments [], :extract/type :article, :time/created #inst "2019-11-07T04:31:25.288-00:00", :source {:doi "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.03.063.

However, rodent fMRI studies of somatosensory stimulation have commonly reported BOLD changes only in S1FL, which may be due to side effects of anesthetics and/or the low sensitivity in the thalamus. Thus, we have obtained mouse BOLD fMRI under newly-adopted ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. High-resolution BOLD fMRI obtained with same imaging parameters at 9.4T versus 15.2T shows the improvement of functional detectability by ≥ 2 times at 15.2T due to higher signal intensity and larger BOLD response. The fMRI responses at 15.2T were robustly observed at well-known somatosensory networks including thalamus. Second, echo-time-dependent BOLD signals are dominant based on multi-echo fMRI data. A ratio of BOLD responses in S1FL to thalamus is ∼2, which is not related to different baseline T or different cerebral blood volume. Third, group-averaged 15.2T BOLD maps show activities in S1FL, S2, motor cortices, and thalamic nuclei, which agree well with neural tracing network data from the Allen Institute, demonstrating that fMRI detects entire somatosensory networks.

This has been studied in mice and humans using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Here we demonstrate that BOLD effects observed in the murine neuromatrix in response to salient somatosensory stimuli are prone to reflect mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) changes, rather than neural activity. We show that a standard electrostimulus typically used in murine somatosensory fMRI can induce substantial elevations in MABP. Equivalent drug-induced MABP changes - without somatosensory stimulation - evoked BOLD patterns in the neuromatrix strikingly similar to those evoked by electrostimulation. This constitutes a serious caveat for murine fMRI. The regional specificity of these BOLD patterns can be attributed to the co-localization of the neuromatrix with large draining veins.
